# PCV Ideathon Official Rules

The PCV Ideathon is an annual student climate tech pitch competition hosted by Penn Climate Ventures
at the University of Pennsylvania. The PCV Ideathon will open on 9/9 and run until 9/25. Competitors
will pitch a business plan to address a climate issue. Competitors will receive access to mentorship
opportunities with experienced investors and operators in the space. The contest will be open and
accessible to Penn students of all backgrounds â€” those without experience in climate
entrepreneurship will have the opportunity to work with mentors to develop ideas to tackle
challenges in climate space.

Challenge prompts will be provided to competitors to guide their project development. The top
pitches will be awarded cash prizes in the intent of further developing their platforms.
