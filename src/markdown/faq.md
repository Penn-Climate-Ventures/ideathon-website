    The PCV Fall Ideathon is a new annual competition where student teams can pitch a climate tech startup concept for a chance at cash prizes in non-dilutive funding, as well as mentorship and publicity opportunities. The Ideathon will be similar in concept to a standard hackathon, where the majority of the competition’s events will take place over a single week.

    <summary>Why is this competition Penn exclusive?</summary>
    The primary goal of our parent organization, Penn Climate Ventures, is to catalyze climate action at Penn and encourage more students to explore climate tech innovation. Penn’s climate entrepreneurship ecosystem is nascent, so to ensure that we’re bringing more Penn students into the picture, we’re putting a focus on the Penn community for the fall iteration of this competition. The Spring Iteration (PCV Prize) however,  will be open to all students irrespective of school affiliation :)
