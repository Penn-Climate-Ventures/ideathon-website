# Challenge Prompts

1. **Agriculture**

    This April, California passed the Climate Corporate Accountability Act, requiring all companies
    doing business in the state and grossing over $1B annual revenue disclose all of their 
    greenhouse gas emissions. While this is good news for carbon accounting companies like 
    CarbonChain, Persefoni, ClimateView, or SINAI Technologies, these groups are still missing a 
    major sector that nets positive carbon costs yet has the potential to be a massive carbon sink: 
    agriculture. Agriculture and forestry is estimated to produce approximately 10% of all GHGs 
    emitted in the US (University of Missouri, https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/g310) and 
    24% globally (EPA, https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data). 
    Propose a solution that enables growers to make data-backed decisions that quantifiably reduce 
    their environmental impact (ie. on-farm greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon sequestration, 
    biodiversity impact, etc.).

<br/>

2. **Protein Alternatives**

    In 2019, Impossible Burger sales spared the equivalent of 81,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas 
    emissions and 900 million gallons of water (Impossible Foods, 
    https://impossiblefoods.com/impact-report-2019) but captured less than 0.2% of the total meat 
    and alternative meat market share. Propose a solution that reduces the adoption barrier of 
    leading alternative protein sources — plant protein, insects, mycoprotein, and cultured meat — 
    and decreases carbon outputs of the alternative protein sector.

<br/>

3. **Food Waste**

    Non-profit conglomerate ReFED has identified reducing portion sizes as the most effective method
    of reducing net CO2e, reducing water usage, and increasing financial benefit worldwide 
    (https://insights-engine.refed.com/solution-database/portion-sizes). Propose a solution that can
    achieve long-term wide-spread adoption.

<br/>

4. **Water Consumption**

    According to a survey by the OECD, the average American withdraws 1,207 cubic meters of water a
     year. At the current rate of consumption, shortages could occur in about half of the freshwater
     basins in the US by 2071 (Brown et al., 2019). Propose a solution towards being water positive,
     that is, replenishing more water than we consume.

<br/>

5. **Air Conditioning**

    MIT’s Technology Review, in a 2020 article, named air conditioning as “the great missed 
    opportunity in the fight against climate change.” In the next 30 years, researchers expect air 
    conditioners to quadruple and account for as much as a 0.5°C rise in global temperatures 
    (https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-prevent-air-conditioners-from-heating-the-planet/). 
    Propose a solution to mitigate, prevent, or reduce the impact of cooling.

<br/>

6. **Renewable Energy**

    While 2020 saw the greatest year-on-year renewables increase in the past 20 years 
    (https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-2021/renewable-electricity), private
    adoption is still limited by factors such as utility rate structures, lack of transmission or
    interconnected standards, and permitting processes. Certain states have adopted policies to
    support greater investment in renewables 
    (https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy/state-renewable-energy-resources), but accessibility to 
    these solutions remain spotty, including in states where the greatest potential for PV-generated 
    electricity lies. Propose a solution that increases the affordability and accessibility of 
    renewable or alternative energy sources.

<br/>

7. **Global Policy**

    In order to develop better laws and policies we need an in-depth understanding of the existing 
    laws and policies, so policymakers can replicate successes and avoid mistakes. Propose a 
    solution towards increasing accessibility in understanding global climate legislation and its 
    impacts.
