If you hope to compete in the final round, make sure you have at least one Penn student on your team.\n</details>\n<details>\n    <summary>What if I don't have a team?</summary>\n    No worries! We're holding a team formation event directly after our opening keynote. Make sure to\n    <a \n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\n        href=\"http://tinyurl.com/PCVPrizeS21\">\n        register as an individual\n    </a> if you are interested in finding a team through this event. Students do not have to be US citizens and non-Penn students do not need to be studying at US colleges or universities.\n</details>\n<details>\n    <summary>I'm working on a startup, but some team members have already graduated. Does every member of my startup’s team need to be a student?</summary>\n    Nope! It’s perfectly fine if you have non-students in your startup. However, only students are allowed to compete in the PCV Prize, so only they can register and pitch.\n    <br>\n    Furthermore, if you are an incorporated startup, at least one of the students presenting must be an owner / managing member listed in the articles of incorporation. No interns presenting for established companies :).\n</details>\n<details>\n    <summary>Can I apply without prior experience with tech or startups?</summary>\n    Definitely! We strongly encourage anyone interested in the PCV Prize or climate innovation to apply. There are no requirements for what a successful PCV Prize team will look like, and we will be hosting workshops to help teams build and strengthen their startup ideas.\n</details>\n<details>\n    <summary>What stage should my startup be?</summary>\n    Early stage - anywhere from just an idea to a working prototype. Importantly, teams must have less than 15K in external funding. As much as we would love to support great and growing climate startups, we’re focused on encouraging new students to enter the scene.\n</details>\n<details>\n    <summary>Why the requirement for Penn students on a team?</summary>\n    The primary goal of our parent organization, Penn Climate Ventures, is to catalyze climate action at Penn and encourage more students to explore climate tech innovation. Penn’s climate entrepreneurship ecosystem is nascent, so to ensure that we’re bringing more Penn students into the picture, we’re putting a focus on the Penn community for the first iteration of this competition.\n</details>\n<h2>Registration</h2>\n<details>\n    <summary>How do I apply?</summary>\n    At minimum, you need to fill out three registration forms:\n    <br>\n    1. \n    <a \n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\n        href=\"http://tinyurl.com/PCVPrizeS21\">\n        Individual Registration Form\n    </a>\n    (Due 4/5 @ 6 PM ET)\n    <br>\n    2.\n    <a \n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\n        href=\"http://tinyurl.com/PCVPrizeTeamRegistration\"\n    >\n        Team Registration Form\n    </a>\n    (Due 4/5 at 6 PM ET)\n    <br>\n    3.\n    <a \n        target=\"_blank\"\n        rel=\"noreferrer noopener\"\n        href=\"http://tinyurl.com/PCVPrizeSubmission\"\n    >\n    First-Round Submission Form\n    </a>\n    (Due 4/16 at 11:59 PM ET)\n</details>\n<h2>Competition Logistics</h2>\n<details>\n    <summary>Are the first-round supplemental materials really optional?</summary>\n    Yup!
