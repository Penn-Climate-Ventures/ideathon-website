Penn’s climate entrepreneurship ecosystem is nascent, so to ensure that we’re bringing more Penn students into the picture, we’re putting a focus on the Penn community for the fall iteration of this competition. The Spring Iteration (PCV Prize) however,  will be open to all students irrespective of school affiliation :)</p>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/faq","title":"FAQs"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/faq"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
