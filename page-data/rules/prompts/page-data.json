While this is good news for carbon accounting companies like\nCarbonChain, Persefoni, ClimateView, or SINAI Technologies, these groups are still missing a\nmajor sector that nets positive carbon costs yet has the potential to be a massive carbon sink:\nagriculture. Agriculture and forestry is estimated to produce approximately 10% of all GHGs\nemitted in the US (University of Missouri, <a href=\"https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/g310\">https://extension.missouri.edu/publications/g310</a>) and\n24% globally (EPA, <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data\">https://www.epa.gov/ghgemissions/global-greenhouse-gas-emissions-data</a>).\nPropose a solution that enables growers to make data-backed decisions that quantifiably reduce\ntheir environmental impact (ie. on-farm greenhouse gas emissions, soil carbon sequestration,\nbiodiversity impact, etc.).</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Protein Alternatives</strong></p>\n<p>In 2019, Impossible Burger sales spared the equivalent of 81,000 tonnes of greenhouse gas\nemissions and 900 million gallons of water (Impossible Foods,\n<a href=\"https://impossiblefoods.com/impact-report-2019\">https://impossiblefoods.com/impact-report-2019</a>) but captured less than 0.2% of the total meat\nand alternative meat market share. Propose a solution that reduces the adoption barrier of\nleading alternative protein sources — plant protein, insects, mycoprotein, and cultured meat —\nand decreases carbon outputs of the alternative protein sector.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Food Waste</strong></p>\n<p>Non-profit conglomerate ReFED has identified reducing portion sizes as the most effective method\nof reducing net CO2e, reducing water usage, and increasing financial benefit worldwide\n(<a href=\"https://insights-engine.refed.com/solution-database/portion-sizes\">https://insights-engine.refed.com/solution-database/portion-sizes</a>). Propose a solution that can\nachieve long-term wide-spread adoption.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\n<ol start=\"4\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Water Consumption</strong></p>\n<p>According to a survey by the OECD, the average American withdraws 1,207 cubic meters of water a\nyear. At the current rate of consumption, shortages could occur in about half of the freshwater\nbasins in the US by 2071 (Brown et al., 2019). Propose a solution towards being water positive,\nthat is, replenishing more water than we consume.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\n<ol start=\"5\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Air Conditioning</strong></p>\n<p>MIT’s Technology Review, in a 2020 article, named air conditioning as “the great missed\nopportunity in the fight against climate change.” In the next 30 years, researchers expect air\nconditioners to quadruple and account for as much as a 0.5°C rise in global temperatures\n(<a href=\"https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-prevent-air-conditioners-from-heating-the-planet/\">https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/how-to-prevent-air-conditioners-from-heating-the-planet/</a>).\nPropose a solution to mitigate, prevent, or reduce the impact of cooling.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\n<ol start=\"6\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Renewable Energy</strong></p>\n<p>While 2020 saw the greatest year-on-year renewables increase in the past 20 years\n(<a href=\"https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-2021/renewable-electricity\">https://www.iea.org/reports/renewable-energy-market-update-2021/renewable-electricity</a>), private\nadoption is still limited by factors such as utility rate structures, lack of transmission or\ninterconnected standards, and permitting processes. Certain states have adopted policies to\nsupport greater investment in renewables\n(<a href=\"https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy/state-renewable-energy-resources\">https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy/state-renewable-energy-resources</a>), but accessibility to\nthese solutions remain spotty, including in states where the greatest potential for PV-generated\nelectricity lies. Propose a solution that increases the affordability and accessibility of\nrenewable or alternative energy sources.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<br/>\n<ol start=\"7\">\n<li>\n<p><strong>Global Policy</strong></p>\n<p>In order to develop better laws and policies we need an in-depth understanding of the existing\nlaws and policies, so policymakers can replicate successes and avoid mistakes. Propose a\nsolution towards increasing accessibility in understanding global climate legislation and its\nimpacts.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>","frontmatter":{"slug":"/rules/prompts","title":"Challenge Prompts"}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/rules/prompts"}},"staticQueryHashes":[]}
